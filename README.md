# Drawer, Tab and Stack Navigator

Created a react-native project that has 3 different types navigators. The drawer and the tab navigators are nested inside the stack navigator. 

## React native Concepts

- Nesting drawer and tab navigator inside stack navigator.
- Using a single file to handle the whole app navigation.
- Configuring each navigator based on the need.
